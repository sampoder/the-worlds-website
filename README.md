"ChatGPT is ruining the web"... I have heard a lot of my friends say that, they complain about the web being full of websites made soley with ChatGPT and no love. They've got a fair point... the only logical response is to make more of these sh*t websites... infinitely more (or up until I lose my OpenAI credits).

So here we have [worst.sampoder.com](https://worst.sampoder.com/). Every time you load the page, ChatGPT is challenged with creating the world's worst website and then you get to see the result. Have fun.
